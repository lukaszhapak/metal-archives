	(1, 'Before the daylight falls to the graves - deadnight shadows Soon I`ll cross through that rift I`ll fly across the sky It`s such a lonely way This one`ll be black The jet black always in the sky It reflects hatred in my eyes If the daylight dies the shadows fall all over me Then death, you`ll have your way Scorn the torment in moonlight`s shadow I can`t get out, lost the way for eternity You`re the guard of the dead ones In the night I`ll find you to drink your blood Still the deadnight`s screaming in my heart The dead of night`s close by! So wake it up, call my name, it`s Deadnight Warrior! Send them on a trip of pain I can`t wait! It`s such a lonely fight This one`ll black The jet black rises to the skies It reflects hatred in my eyes Feeling such a pain to die now Being a hungry wolf Crying under the moonlight`s shadow Sensing you'),
	(2, 'The time has come Goddess forsaken, a distant memory for mankind Thousand of years confined in lethargy away from the conscience Open your eyes and wake up, behold this betrayal, for those whom you gave life forgot you, it`s time for them to die! Rise and fall, it`s time to be born again Fire will rain, the end will soon begin The time has come! Ancient heralding revives deep within your guts, unconscious spark of life imperceptible to human eyes. The broken bond will never heal, we`re under nature`s will. Our future seems so dark, there is no turning back! Rise and fall, it`s time to be born again Fire will rain, the end will soon begin The time has come Empires crumble, when nature awakes! The black storm is coming I hear the sound of death Dark thunders are blasting above the mankind skies Rain falls from the heavens water soon will drown our lives The fury of nature will drench our souls Now... Rise and fall, it`s time to be born again. Fire will rain, the end will soon begin. The time has come. Empires crumble, when nature awakes! '),
